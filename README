This chatting program achieved arduino-to-arduino communication over an
encrypted serial link in which the Diffie-Hellman shared secret protocol is used
to establish a shared key. The two arduinos exchange keys automatically
And it uses XOR encryption to encrypt the messages.
Users can simply type to communicate safely.

Accessories:
*2 × Arduino Mega 2650 board.
*n × Cables
*1 x Resistor

Wiring:
* for the server arduino
  connect PIN 13 to 5V through any resistor
* for the client arduino
  connect PIN 13 to GND
* for both arduinos
  GND <-> GND(connect to another Arduino board)
  TX3 <-> RX3(connect to another Arduino board)
  RX3 <-> TX3(connect to another Arduino board)
--------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN CODE:
1.Make sure both Arduino boards are properly connected
2.Navigate to the directory contains all the .cpp and .h files
 from the compressed zip and make sure they are in the same directory
3.Enter command "make upload" at terminal to compile and upload the program
4.When there is an issue with connection between the Arduino and the VM
  Enter 'arduino-port-select' at terminal, enter '1' for twice
5.Enter 'serial-mon' to run the code at terminal;
6.The arduinos will automatically exchange the keys
7.Begin Chat! press enter to go to next line
